# Summary

Susan 2.0 is a large format reprap i3 style printer.  It's based on the classic Prusa i3 but features much beefier connection parts to ensure strength and stability for larger frames.  The frame itself is made from 3030 aluminum extrusion and can be scaled to make a variety of build volumes.  I built mine with 20" extrusions for X & Y, and 24" extrusions for z, giving it a 14x14x16" build volume.  The hotend is an E3D-v6 with a mk8 style direct-drive extruder and proximity sensor probe for finding Z and mesh leveling the build platform.  The bed is topped with a PEI sheet to help part adhesion.  A separate high-voltage silicone heater and controller are used to heat the bed.  The printer is controlled using a Rambo 1.3 Mini running Marlin.  All the motion components run on 10mm chromed linear shafts to ensure accuracy and durability.  Each component is fixed to the frame using M4 slide nuts and M4 12mm screws.

I am currently building a second Susan 2.0 and will be photographing the entire assembly process to make a guide on how to assemble this printer.  However, anyone who has built a printer before could surely figure out the assembly steps just from the part files and pictures.
